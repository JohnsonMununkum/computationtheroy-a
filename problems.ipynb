    "### \n",
    "The parity function executes a bitwise XOR operation on three 32-bit integers.it compares each bit posistion for all the three inputs. At each bit position, we count how many of the three inputs have a 1 at that spot. if we count 1 or 3 ones there are an odd number of bits, the output is 1. If we count 0 or 2 ones there are an even number of bits, the output is 0.\n",

    "**Purpose:** Computes the bitwise parity of three inputs\n",
    "**Formula:** Parity(x, y, z) = x ⊕ y ⊕ z\n",
    "**Behavior:** Returns 1 when an odd number of bits are set & 0 if even number of bits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "We will use the formula Parity(x, y, z) = x ⊕ y ⊕ z to get the executed results. We enter three 32-bit integers for the values x, y, z & then will use the XOR operator ^ to combine all 3 values. I added a 32-bit mask (& 0xFFFFFFFF) to make sure that the result stays in the 32- bit integer range. then returned the result as a numpy uint32 type.\n",
