    "### \n",
    "The parity function executes a bitwise XOR operation on three 32-bit integers.it compares each bit posistion for all the three inputs. At each bit position, we count how many of the three inputs have a 1 at that spot. if we count 1 or 3 ones there are an odd number of bits, the output is 1. If we count 0 or 2 ones there are an even number of bits, the output is 0.\n",

    "**Purpose:** Computes the bitwise parity of three inputs\n",
    "**Formula:** Parity(x, y, z) = x ⊕ y ⊕ z\n",
    "**Behavior:** Returns 1 when an odd number of bits are set & 0 if even number of bits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "We will use the formula Parity(x, y, z) = x ⊕ y ⊕ z to get the executed results. We enter three 32-bit integers for the values x, y, z & then will use the XOR operator ^ to combine all 3 values. I added a 32-bit mask (& 0xFFFFFFFF) to make sure that the result stays in the 32- bit integer range. then returned the result as a numpy uint32 type.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Maj(Majority) Function does a majority vote operation on the three 32-bits integers.For each bit position, it looks at the corresponding bits \n",
    "from all three inputs x, y, z and returns the value that appears the most. Say if two or more inputs have a 1 at that position the output is\n",
    "1 vice versa if two or more inputs have a 0 the output is then 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Returns the value that appears the most across x, y, z\n",
    "Formula: Maj(x,y,z)=(x∧y)⊕(x∧z)⊕(y∧z)\n",
    "Behaviour: Returns 1 if atleast 2 of the three inputs have a 1 at that bit position, or else returns 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "Here the formula Maj(x,y,z)=(x∧y)⊕(x∧z)⊕(y∧z) is used to perform the majority operation.\n",
    "We initalize three 32-bit integers x, y, z.The function works by comparing pairs, \n",
    "First we use the AND (&) to find where both x & y have a 1, \n",
    "Then AND (&) again to see where x & z have a 1. \n",
    "Then we use AND (&) to find where y & z have a 1. \n",
    "Then we XOR (^) all three results together to get the final answer.\n",
    "I used a 32-bit mask (& 0xFFFFFFFF) to make sure that the result stays in the 32- bit integer range.\n",
    "then returned the result as a numpy uint32 type.\n",

    "^ operator does the bitwise XOR operation\n",
    "np.uint32() makes sure that the values are treated as 32-bit unsigned integers\n",
