# Computational Theory Assignment
SHA Implementation and Analysis

This Repository contains my solutions to the computational theory assignment problems, focusing on implementing the SHA hasing algorithm from the Secure Hash Standard.The assignment demonstrates computational theory concepts through bitwise operations, function implementations and hashing examples.

## Project Repository
problems.ipynb - The Jupyter notebook with all the problem solutions, code explanations, tests and markdown documentation.

.gitignore - Makes sure that unnecessary files are removed from the repository.

## Project Setup
- Clone the repository:
    git clone "https://github.com/JohnsonMununkum/computationtheroy-a.git"

    cd computationtheroy-a

- Install Python 3.7 or higher if needed.
- Install the required packages.
    pip install numpy
- Try this if pip is giving errors

    python -m pip install numpy
- Then run Jupyter Notebook from the project directory.

    jupyter notebook
- After running Jupyter Notebook, open problems.ipynb and run the cells.The notebook is designed to run smoothly with all the imports placed at the top.

## Documentation
- All imports are at the beginning of the notebook.
- Markdown cells give explanations, formulas, and conceptual context to go with the code.
- The code cells are commented and broken down into manageable sections ,helping with readability and understanding.

## References
- https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf,the source for the SHA-256 algorithm implemented.

- https://numpy.org/doc/, for numerical and bitwise operations.

This README allows anyone that is viewing or using my repository to clearly understand the setup, running and the structure behind my work.
